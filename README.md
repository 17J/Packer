# Packer And Packer With Terraform

`-` Packer is a tool for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration.

This repository contains examples showcasing the use of HashiCorp Packer for building machine images. It's divided into two main sections: basic Packer examples and examples integrating Packer with Terraform.

This directory contains standalone Packer examples demonstrating various aspects of Packer, such as:

- **Building basic images:** Examples showing how to create simple images for different platforms.
- **Provisioning:** Examples using various provisioners (shell, Ansible, etc.) to configure the images.
- **Variables and templates:** Examples demonstrating the use of variables and templates for creating flexible Packer configurations.
- **Different builders:** Examples for AWS, Azure, GCP, VirtualBox, etc.

### How to use these examples:

1.  Navigate to the specific example directory you want to explore (e.g., `cd Packer_examples/example1`).
2.  Ensure you have Packer installed.
3.  Initialize Packer: `packer init .`
4.  Validate the Packer template: `packer validate .`
5.  Build the image: `packer build .`

**Example:**

```bash
cd Packer_examples/example1/
packer init .
packer validate .
packer build .
```

# Packer_terraform_combine_example Directory

This directory demonstrates how to integrate Packer with Terraform for infrastructure as code. These examples show how to:

```bash
cd Packer_terraform_combine_example/
packer init .
packer validate .
packer build .  # Use Created Nginx AMI ID Then Move Ahead


terraform init
terraform apply
terraform destroy
```

## Prerequisites

- Packer: Install Packer from the official HashiCorp website.
- Terraform: Install Terraform from the official HashiCorp website.
- Cloud Provider CLI (if applicable): Install and configure the CLI for your chosen cloud provider (AWS CLI, Azure CLI, GCP CLI, etc.).
- Cloud Provider Credentials: Configure your cloud provider credentials for Packer and Terraform to access your cloud resources.
